Critical infrastructure supports economic competitiveness and resilience:
- Transportation networks that connect regions to markets
- Broadband infrastructure enabling digital economy participation
- Water and energy systems supporting sustainable development

3. Workforce Development
Human capital is fundamental to regional economic resilience:
- Skills training aligned with industry needs
- Support for lifelong learning and reskilling
- Programs to retain and attract talent

4. Innovation and Technology Transfer
Technology adoption drives productivity and competitiveness:
- University-industry partnerships
- Research and development investments
- Support for technology commercialization

Regional partnerships are essential for coordinating economic development efforts across jurisdictions and sectors. EDA encourages collaborative approaches that leverage resources and expertise from multiple stakeholders.
